# sc++
A modification to the C++ language syntax

scpp is a program that converts sc++ code into buildable c++ code


## Syntax
The sc++ language has some major differences to c++.

#### variable declaration
```
var i :int = 5;
```
The variable declaration is inspired by Rust, but using `var` instead of `let`
